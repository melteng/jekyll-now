for _CM630: Topics in Civic Media_ \\
Spring 2018


### 1. Topic & background
**immersive spaces for constructing civic imagination** \\
As mixed reality and IoT technologies increasingly allow people to "immerse" themselves into curated, augmented experiences, it is worth exploring the potential for these spaces to inspire a greater [civic imagination](https://www.civicimaginationproject.org/theory) -- or "the capacity to imagine alternatives to current cultural, social, political, or economic conditions."

In particular, I am interested in temporary immersive spaces (ephemeral, portable, "vacation" spaces) that are *shared* and the learning opportunities created by these alternative experiences to perform and re-imagine the *self* and the *self in relation to society*, especially in ways that carry back into "reality" (or in memory).

Freud described personal memory as being constructed, drawn from an untapped, unconscious memory bank, while David Lowenthal wrote, "The past is a foreign country." On a societal level, scholars have written about the malleability of cultural memory and need for reflexive historical processes. As our collective remembered realities are increasingly "mixed" (virtual or augmented), what are the opportunities for cultivating a stronger and far-reaching civic imagination?

I will start with a field scan of other constructed/appropriated temporary immersive spaces and how they were used to explore and bolster civic imagination. Readings will be supplemented with regular technology/design experiments. Last, I will build my own immersive performance experience inspired by one topic area or project studied this semester. I imagine the medium will be a VR app but the medium is flexible. A potential prompt would be a re-imagining of gentrifying neighborhoods.

##### broad keywords: civic imagination, critical world building, mixed reality, total cinema, identity performance, cult culture, social script

#### 1.1 background
- Decreasing cost and barrier to entry of immersion (or escapism): through screens/headphones (mobile devices/mp3 players), the Internet (social media, virtual worlds like SecondLife), video games, festivals (e.g. Burning Man), backpacker tourism (e.g. Kathmandu, San Pedro, Bali), guilty pleasure vacations (Vegas, Times Square, Phuket), drugs, mixed reality technologies.
- A need to reimagine and redesign existing civic infrastructure, rooted in exclusion, in the face of increasingly complex demographics in society.


### 2. Goals and Objectives
#### 2.1 what you hope to achieve
To study historical and contemporary immersive environments in approaching civic media projects, learn the technologies involved in VR/AR development, create an immersive piece using VR.

#### 2.2 objectives
1. Study historical and contemporary immersive environments and cultures
2. Explore how performance is used in these augmented environments to redefine the self and the self in relation to others
3. Create immersive pieces to ground readings


### 3. Core Project Questions
_What are the core questions that will guide your work?_
- Historically, what were other low-tech immersive/augmented environments people created or co-opted to influence culture?
- What are the benefits of immersive experiences in creating "real" relationships and personal/culture change? What are the limits?
- To what extent is the performed self carried back to "reality"/society after the immersive experience is over?
- Is there a potential to address capitalism through moving, collective immersive experiences?
