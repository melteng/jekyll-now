for _CM630: Topics in Civic Media_ \\
Spring 2018


### 1. Topic & background
**Immersive/Augmented Spaces as a Collective Authentic, Learning Experience** \\
I'm interested in exploring constructed/induced immersive environments and how they can influence individuals' or groups' performance of culture/identity, while immersed and while outside (in memory). What is the civic potential for AR and what were the civic uses of various "augmented" spaces throughout history?\\

##### broad keywords: critical world building, mixed reality, cultural memory, total cinema, performance, cult culture, Disneyfication, visual culture, internet as performance space, virtue signalling

#### 1.1 background
- culture and identity are performative, negotiated;
- increasing economic viability / social acceptance / industry use of immersive technologies like VR/AR/MR;
- labels and easily datafied mediums (text, images, video) are privileged in today's visual and social profile culture (leading to "virtue signalling" (overuse of buzzwords in marketing/gov/academia) or slippery labels like "feminist" (Aziz Ansari));
- overstimulating visual culture (improved SPFX in movies, accessible visuals through internet) and "Disneyfication" [spectacular commercialization] of physical environments, including urban skylines (e.g. Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai) and commercial/fun centers (e.g. Times Square, Vegas, Phuket);
- escapism of video games, festivals (Burning Man, music festivals), virtual worlds (SecondLife), forums;
- increasing demographic complexity in society; immersive experiences as bonding opportunities

#### 1.2 context & why
As technologies increasingly allow people to "immerse" themselves into curated, private bubbles, it is worth exploring the potential for immersive/augmented spaces to help create authentic relationships, understanding, and solidarity.


### 2. Goals and Objectives
#### 2.1 what you hope to achieve
Explore if there is a potential to draw lessons from historical and contemporary immersive environment-building (and world building) in approaching civic media projects, especially those addressing communities from a place of liberation.

#### 2.2 objectives
1. Study historical and contemporary immersive environments and cultures
2. Explore how performance is used in these augmented environments to redefine the self (?)
3. Create immersive pieces to ground readings


### 3. Core Project Questions
_What are the core questions that will guide your work?_
- Historically, what were other low-tech immersive/augmented environments people created or co-opted to influence culture?
- What are the benefits of immersive experiences in creating "real" relationships and personal/culture change? What are the limits?
- To what extent is the performed self carried back to "reality"/society after the immersive experience is over?
- Is there a potential to address capitalism through moving, collective immersive experiences?
