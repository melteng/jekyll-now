There are plenty of upsides to creating web-based VR. The accessibility is unparalleled; despite the decreasing prices of VR headsets, webVR is accessible to anyone with a smartphone and internet access. For the average early adopters of new technologies like virtual reality, this accessibility means vibrant developer communities that share new tools, tips, and creative experiments that test and grow the natural capabilities of the medium (see the communities on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) and Twitter). These communities are comprised of game makers, filmmakers, entrepreneurs, designers, artists, and engineers. Increasingly, professionals from other fields eager to incorporate spatial augmented reality technologies are joining these communities, from medical doctors to architects.

However there are limitations to web-based VR. First is access to WiFi. Second is the processing power and load time. Knowing that some users may load VR web scenes over cellular data, it’s important for web developers to optimize their code and assets, in particular bitmap images, videos, and audio. This is why many webVR games use low poly assets (e.g. [geometric 3D polygons](https://poly.google.com/)). This severely limits the kind of experiences given current phone capabilities. However, on a platform like the Vive or Oculus, the load of the VR program is not a big deal.

The other important limitation of WebVR is the degree of freedom in movement and interaction. Phones offer three degrees of freedom (dof): x, y, and z. You cannot move around a space as the phone acts as the origin point. Camera movement is controlled by clicks or keystrokes. However, with a headset paired with handheld motion controllers, the user can enjoy 6 dof, meaning the headset can track the user’s movement as they walk around a play area.
