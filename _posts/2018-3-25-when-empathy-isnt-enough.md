title: The limits of designing for empathy

Today I found a simple but powerful [zine](http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nolady-unimposed-1.pdf) created by [@prisonculture](http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/), with the help of artist [Neta Bomani](https://twitter.com/netabomani), that commemorates an untitled poem written by someone incarcerated in an Illinois women’s prison in the mid-70s. The poem was published in the now-defunct newspaper, *Chicago Seed* in 1981.

It begins:

*No Lady\\
Prison didn’t improve me none.\\
There was ten of us girls in the county jail\\
five white, five black awaitin’ trial for sellin shit.\\
The white girls, they all on probation.\\
Us black girls, we all go to Dwight. Me, three months gone.*

Below is an excerpt, with the poet describing her release from prison and facing discrimination at work:

You can find the whole zine by Prison Culture and Neta Bomani [here](http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nolady-unimposed-1.pdf).

While the zine's confrontational visual design wears the poem like a bold protest sign, the prose itself reads like someone stuck in a fight she did not choose. I had to remind myself that this is a forty-year-old poem, as nothing really distinguishes the sentiments here with that of a prison story written in 2018. Over the last few weeks, I've been been reading about the experiences of women in the US prison system, as well as the institutions, practices, and legacies that make up the larger system of mass incarceration. This research is exciting, endless, at times inspiring and heartwarming, but most times maddening, frustrating, and depressing.

A major reason I wanted to share this poem and zine was to remind myself how art can lighten and light up the mental processing of heavy subjects, by recasting them in new forms and creating space to examine darkness through beauty.

The re-publication of this poem today is sobering in light of the present state of mass incarceration. Since the 1970s, the US incarcerated population has skyrocketed from around 300k to over 2 million. The US now has the largest incarcerated population of any developed country in the world. Black people still make up a disproportionate share of those incarcerated. And while many more men are in prison than women, the rate of growth for female imprisonment has outpaced that of men by more than 50% between 1980 and 2014 (1).

Inundated with numbers daily -- stock ticks, death counts, bodies marching -- sometimes I have trouble making sense of it all. This sounds awful, but what can I do? We coexist with systemic injustice, so what are the implications for me? I wonder how data can be humanely presented to convey the true gravity of a *system* that sees over 2 million people incarcerated and millions more in broken families and neighborhoods? Compounding the numbing sensation is the enormity of the problem: can we imagine a shared sense of care for a million or even a thousand individuals? (This imagining is the foundation of nations and movements.)

More recently, I've been thinking about the limits of empathy and how to still design something meaningful for users.

When I was a ux designer in the web application/platform industry, my design process began with talking to users, trying to develop an understanding of their needs (empathy), creating a prototype from this research, and then testing it with users and collecting feedback. Success hinged on the designer's understanding of the user's needs and feedback. It wasn't so hard to design for intuition, responsiveness, or delight when my users were not so different from me by technology access, upbringing, education, rights and freedoms, or priorities. More or less, I could put myself in my users' shoes.

But for my thesis, I am designing a reentry service for female-identifying inmates. Every time I read about the prison-industrial complex, under-resourced neighborhoods, and broken families, I am reminded of my privileges because the situations and stories are sometimes so horrible that they process like fiction. It would be vain to think that ethnographic/user research (in the few months I have) could be enough to empathize or understand some people's pains, needs, and priorities. Where empathy breaks down is where trust, faith, and partnership start. This sentiment of solidarity is nothing new for organizers building towards racial equity: *I cannot understand the complexities of your experiences, but I am here support your cause however you need me to.*

This is all to say, I can better appreciate why some design processes must be participatory to be successful. When empathy isn't enough, user research provides data that can support group facilitation, relationship building, and conflict mediation.
