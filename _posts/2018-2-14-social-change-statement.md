## Designs Without Solutions
"Innovation" and "design thinking" go hand-in-hand with an optimistic drive to create solutions. Design thinking is an approach first championed by IDEO in Silicon Valley that promises a human-centered, data-driven, and agile (iterative with a bias for action) approach to solving "wicked problems" -- a hype captured [in this NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/fashion/design-thinking-stanford-silicon-valley.html). From sensational media coverage of design-first startups like Airbnb to the surge in related publications after the 2008 financial crisis, design thinking has built a reputation for disrupting archaic systems. Unsurprisingly design thinking has been widely adopted by government and corporate strategists, an appeal that suggests a search for something needed within management (Johansson-Sköldberg et. al., 2013).

For projects that address civic issues or affect a public good, a faith in problem-solving may be naively presumptuous at best and harmfully reductionist of public issues at worst. Designers Dunne and Raby put into perspective the optimism baked into design thinking:

>“Faced with huge challenges such as overpopulation, water shortages, and climate change, designers feel an overpowering urge to work together to fix them, as though they can be broken down, quantified, and solved. Design’s inherent optimism leaves no alternatives but it is becoming clear that many of the challenges we face today are unfixable and that the only way to overcome them is by changing our values, beliefs, attitudes, and behavior.” (*Speculative Everything*, p. 2)

While design thinking is good at helping organizations to disrupt traditional models, design is not apolitical; if innovation operates within and does not challenge structures that have formed/calcified through histories of dispassionate oppression, then the resulting designs are complicit in perpetuating these structures. This is especially important for "social innovation" design projects that involve civic issues. If we want to really see social change, rather than view design as a problem-solving tool, we can re-frame design as a tool for liberation. *Designing for liberation* was a concept presented to our class by the team behind the [Make the Breast Pump Not Suck hackathon + summit](https://www.makethebreastpumpnotsuck.com/) during a discussion on the ["day of racial healing."](https://www.wkkf.org/news-and-media/article/2017/01/national-day-of-racial-healing-jan-17)

## A Theory of Change vs. A Theory of Social Change
Whereas the theory of change asks how to define and position oneself to tackle a problem (e.g. a community needs more reentry services for the increased number of newly released inmates), the theory of social change asks what are the root causes of the condition in the first place (e.g. the myriad of sociological, political, economic factors that led to an increase in individuals reentering the community).

**Theory of Change**
1. *Analysis*: What assumptions exist about the problem, the population served, and how that problem should be addressed?
2. *Service Goals*: What is the service goal of the project?
3. *Resources You Need*: What resources would be needed in order to meet those service goals?
4. *Activities*: What activities are needed to meet the service goals?

**Theory of Social Change**
1. *Analysis*: What are the root causes of the condition that the mission addresses?
2. *Social Change Goals*: What might be the systemic changes that the agency might want to work toward?
3. *Resources You Have*: What resources (i.e. community relationships and coalitions, facilitation space, technological capacity) do you have that you can apply to your social change goals?
4. *Strategies*: What are examples of strategies that might be used in working for systemic change?

The theory of change results in a service that may or may not communicate with existing services, while the theory of social change begins with existing resources to create a strategy and service as needed. This strategy or service may not naturally fit the timeline of short-term grants or awards, but it acknowledges the entrenched complexity, long-term building, and big picture visioning needed of sustainable change.
