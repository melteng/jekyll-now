My goal is to explore Chinatown’s history, tackling misconceptions and stereotypes at the same time. One idea would be a cross section of historical buildings, working with the data available on Chinatown. If the data is rich enough, we could build a 4-d map, combining data from government, business, individuals. My partners would be the creator of Chinatown Atlas, a professor emeritus at MIT’s School of Planning.

The second project would be a participatory mediamaking project. Given Chinatown has always been a hub more than a residency, I'm curious to explore individual’s perceptions of the neighborhood’s cultural identity as it’s shifting today. It seems that there is a clear generational gap between perception (today, restaurants are higher end and bubble tea). What happens if we give everyone cameras and ask them to film Chinatown? Or projectors and asked them to map/augment an area? Everyone in the community would be invited to the screening. My partner would be BCNC as they are already involved in youth, tourism, and neighborhood resource activities.

The third project would be addressing *cultural* displacement through gentrification, or what happens to culture when gentrification specifically displaces an ethnic minority. One perception is that change happens and realistically Chinatown will be replaced like DC’s (culturally diluted with bilingual/Chinese signs). Already stronger “Chinatown” groups live in Quincy and Malden. What is Boston losing? This project would involve interviews, participatory media making, to understand and put words to the cultural loss accompanying rapid capital-driven growth, so that in talking about this, there is a framework.
