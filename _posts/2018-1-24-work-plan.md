Clearly articulate what the final product of your directed study will be, in as much detail as possible.

#Challenges to Completion

#Weekly Schedule
Once you have completed steps 1-6, produce a weekly schedule that follows the class and places nos. 4 & 5 specifically into a concreted plan for the semester.

#Format & Length
While lengths may vary, I anticipate a strong work plan from 2-4 pages. Work plans should be made in Google Docs, where links can be shared and updates created on a regular basis.
