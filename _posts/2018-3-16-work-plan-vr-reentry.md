title: work plan for exploring the US Prison System through VR
tags: directed-study reentry

### 1. Topic & background
#### 1.1 background
The United States has the world’s highest adult incarceration rate, with over 2.2 million currently in jails and prisons. Though only a fraction of the male carceral population, the growth rate of female imprisonment outpaced that of men by more than 50% between 1980 and 2014, from about 26,000 incarcerated women in 1980 to over 215,000 in 2014 (1). At least 95 percent of all inmates in the U.S. will ultimately be released and returned to the community—many without parole and some with no supervision—but more than 60% of former state prisoners are rearrested within three years of release and 76% within five years (2, 3). Women are especially vulnerable following release, with a lack of women-specific reentry community services and mothers experiencing stigmas differently than fathers. In addition to finding stable housing and work, female ex-offenders often feel pressure to provide for their families and communities, while potentially suffering from trauma from physical or sexual abuse or from mental illness. Women often feel pressure to a relapse to substance abuse or crime, which can lead to rearrest, perpetuating the damage to their families, children, and communities.

In conversation with prison staff, it is clear that formerly incarcerated women experienced heightened anxiety upon reentry and were not prepared for navigating daily encounters. Common causes of anxiety were overstimulation by bright lights and colors, loud noises, crowded environments, and an overwhelming selection of unfamiliar choices in daily activities. Small details in quotidian tasks (e.g. swiping cards when boarding a bus, browsing aisles of products when shopping, noticing security cameras while driving) were sometimes challenging or triggering for those who were not given the opportunity to adjust to modern society naturally. Even those incarcerated for as little as six months reported experiencing difficulty reintegrating into the community, experiencing embarrassment as an adult, anger, and anxiety when faced with stressful situations.

There might be an opportunity with virtual reality (VR) technologies to offer inmates controlled, immersive, and game-like exposure to simulated reentry scenarios, prior to their actual release from prison. In a VR set up, sensory information is delivered through a head-mounted display that is able to track natural head movements, creating a convincing immersive experience.

### 2. Goals and Objectives
#### 2.1 what you hope to achieve
For my thesis, I am exploring how a co-designed VR experience might help alleviate anxiety for formerly incarcerated women reentering the community. This directed study proposal aims to complement this co-design process by examining within the larger US prison system, with an emphasis on the unique experiences and challenges of women and female-identified people. Concurrently I will be exploring VR as an artistic and storytelling medium, with an (initial) emphasis on mixing it with traditional documentary mediums like audio, photos, and video footage.

#### 2.2 objectives
1. Study the experience and systemic pressures of women and female-identifying people in the US prison system
2. Learn about different methods for creating work in VR that involves audio, footage, and photography
3. Create a VR piece about the experience of women/female-identifying people in the US prison system


### 3. Core Project Questions
_What are the core questions that will guide your work?_
- What are the systemic pressures, challenges, and barriers for a woman and female-identifying person reentering the community?
- How can a VR experiment using related audio, footage, and photography activate and express the stories of women reentering the community, as well as convey the systemic pressures of the US prison system for females?
