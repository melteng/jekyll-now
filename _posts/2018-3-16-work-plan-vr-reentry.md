title: Work Plan - Prison and Virtual Reality
tags: directed-study reentry
---

### 1. Topic & background
#### 1.1 Background
The United States has the world’s highest adult incarceration rate, with over 2.2 million currently in jails and prisons. Though only a fraction of the male carceral population, the growth rate of female imprisonment outpaced that of men by more than 50% between 1980 and 2014, from about 26,000 incarcerated women in 1980 to over 215,000 in 2014 (1). At least 95 percent of all inmates in the U.S. will ultimately be released and returned to the community—many without parole and some with no supervision—but more than 60% of former state prisoners are rearrested within three years of release and 76% within five years (2, 3). Women are especially vulnerable following release, with a lack of women-specific reentry community services and mothers experiencing stigmas differently than fathers. In addition to finding stable housing and work, female ex-offenders often feel pressure to provide for their families and communities, while potentially suffering from trauma from physical or sexual abuse or from mental illness. Women often feel pressure to a relapse to substance abuse or crime, which can lead to rearrest, perpetuating the damage to their families, children, and communities.

There might be an opportunity with virtual reality (VR) technologies to offer inmates controlled, immersive, and game-like exposure to simulated reentry scenarios, prior to incarcerated women's actual release from prison. In a VR set up, sensory information is delivered through a head-mounted display that is able to track natural head movements, creating a convincing immersive experience.

### 2. Goals and Objectives
#### 2.1 What you hope to achieve
For my thesis, I am exploring how a co-designed VR experience might ease the reentry experience for women inmates in Massachusetts. This work plan proposal aims to complement my thesis by examining the larger US prison system, with an emphasis on the unique experiences and challenges of women and female-identified people. Concurrently I will be exploring VR as a storytelling medium in low-technology environments like prison.

#### 2.2 Objectives
1. Study the experience and systemic pressures of women and female-identifying people in the US prison system
2. Learn about the affordances and limitations of virtual reality in low-technology environments like prison


### 3. Core Project Questions
1. What are the systemic pressures, challenges, and barriers for a woman and female-identifying person reentering the community?
2. What are common stories of women reentering the community across the U.S.?
3. What are ways that virtual reality be used for healing and calming, specifically for newly released inmates or individuals with an criminal record facing the systemic constraints of the US prison system?
