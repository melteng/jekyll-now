title: Technical Considerations for VR in Low-Tech Environments

#### Tech constraints in the prison environments:
1. No wifi
2. No phones
3. No dedicated open space for an expensive virtual reality set-up
4. High security for all technology brought in
5. Population is not exposed to technology on a daily basis

#### Technical considerations
Content must be downloaded for offline, fully accessible in its full form without relying on loading new data based on new interactions. This limits the ability to update apps over the cloud, which affects the maintenance cycle.

Headsets need to be attached to a computer for rendering and these computers can be in the form of laptops or towers. For low-tech environments, the more portable the better, requiring fairly powerful laptops. On the other hand, most VR labs tend to opt for stationary tower-based setups in a dedicated VR play area or room.

The headset must also be portable. We tested with the Lenovo Explorer headset, which is not as powerful as the HTC Vive but is purportedly one of the easier and more portable headsets to set up. It has a 10-min set-up process and does not require the installation of external sensors in the room. The laptops tend to be gaming PCs (not Macs), with powerful processing and graphics capabilities.
