title: Who benefits from prison labor?

The main justifications for prison labor is that it prevents idleness and teaches inmates marketable skills. However, when many prison jobs are manufacturing jobs that have left the US, it begs the question: how much of the prison labor industry is about rehabilitation and how much is it about exploiting in-land cheap labor (working for less than $1/hour) to bolster the US government and corporations?

In this [*Economist* article](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21718897-idaho-prisoners-roast-potatoes-kentucky-they-sell-cattle-prison-labour), published in March 2017, the author writes that prison labour is legally required in America. The Bureau of Prisons operates a federal-level program known as [Federal Prison Industries](https://www.unicor.gov/index.aspx) (or UNICOR or FPI) that pays inmates ~$0.90/hour to produce factory items like mattresses, spectacles, road signs, and body armor for other government agencies, while raking in $500M in sales in fiscal year 2016.

From the [Bureau of Prison's website](https://www.bop.gov/about/agency/org_fpi.jsp):
> Federal Prison Industries (FPI) is the largest inmate-training program operated by the Bureau of Prisons and one of the most important correctional programs in the Department of Justice. Created by Federal statute in 1934, FPI operates as a wholly owned, self-sustaining government corporation under the trade name UNICOR. FPI employs and provides skills training to Federal inmates in diverse factory settings and contributes to the safety and security of Bureau facilities by keeping inmates constructively occupied.

From [UNICOR's website](https://www.unicor.gov/PieProgram.aspx):
> UNICOR is a federal government program that truly "works" in every sense of the word, while providing the added benefit of changing lives. UNICOR's PIECP program provides a readily available workforce in low cost manufacturing facilities to more competitively produce your products or provide your services. Inmates gain marketable job skills in a realistic work setting which improve their successful transition back to society as contributing, tax-paying citizens, and the prospects to secure sustainable employment.

Public run prisons in the US have provided labour to private companies since 1979, when more than 5,000 inmates took part in the [*Prison Industry Enhancement*](https://www.unicor.gov/PieProgram.aspx). In contracts, there are many euphemisms used. UNICOR describes government-run prison production schemes as “correctional industries” and refers to its facilities as “factories with fences” in reports.

Given the US recidivism rate is [76.6% within five years](https://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/Pages/welcome.aspx), it is clear that existing programs do not truly "work" to change inmates' lives for the better. But some people's lives were better. The day after Trump was elected, the share price of CoreCivic (fka [Corrections Corporation of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreCivic), the second largest private prison corporation in the US), increased 43% in anticipation of new contracts with expanded immigration detention centers. CoreCivic/CCA already derived 51% of its revenue from federal contracts in 2015, but it was sure to receive windfall profits with the Trump administration's plans to expand the US's detention capacity at border immigration centers by over 450%, especially targeting women and children. In a familiar pattern, private prison corporations have successfully lobbied for "immigration reform" much as they did for "Tough On Crime" and privatization in the 1980s and 1990s.

It is also worth pointing out that CCA is a publicly owned company, so it acts to protect against anything that would threaten its profitability, including maintaining a steady or increasing number of occupied beds and cheap labor. Release from prison is bad for business. The CCA's website is upfront about its reentry services: basic adult education, post-secondary education, GRE preparation, and testing and literacy programs for all inmates. But in a 2008 report by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, they found only 60% of privately run facilities offered these services to inmates. The CCA has a [long history of ethical issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreCivic#cite_ref-28), everything from mistreatment of inmates (underfeeding to ignoring massive scabies outbreaks) to hiring executives from contract agencies.
