Originally I had framed my work plan as:

> As mixed reality and IoT technologies increasingly allow people to “immerse” themselves into curated, augmented experiences, it is worth exploring the potential for these spaces to inspire a greater civic imagination – or “the capacity to imagine alternatives to current cultural, social, political, or economic conditions.”

Frank Rose, author of *The Art of Immersion* (2012), would argue that people have long been “immersing” themselves to some degree with media technologies, dating back to the earliest known English novel (*Robinson Crusoe*, 1719). Mass media--tv, radio, film--crafted audio/visual narratives to address entire markets. Today a new type of storytelling--what Rose terms “deep media”--is taking shape, fueled by the inherently nonlinear, connected, participatory, mixed-media, and gamelike Internet. Deep media is designed to be immersive, or giving the sense of being able to “drill down as deeply as you like about anything you care to.” Examples of deep media include the alternative reality game [*I Love Bees*](http://www.ilovebees.co/) for *Halo II* (advertising), the multi-layered fan-contributed story of *Star Wars* (entertainment), and an individual’s interlinked social media profiles (autobiography).

(As an aside, Rose mentions Henry Jenkins several times in *The Art of Immersion*, though more as a scholar of transmedia storytelling than of civic imagination. He also weaves in figures as diverse as [*Remix*](http://remix.lessig.org/) author Lawrence Lessig, network theorist Albert-László Barabási, directors David Lynch and James Cameron, and author Philip K. Dick--who speaks on his impressions of Disneyland, no less. Reality/unreality dream team. This book carried me through a 17-hour plane ride.)

While by no means an exhaustive list, Rose essentially took the broad concept of “media immersion” and gave it a definition and framework by highlighting a network of individuals pushing the immersive potential of today’s Internet-augmented media landscape. His case studies span the fields of film, television, video games, advertising, social media, and neuroscience.

On the other hand, my work plan looked at a scattershot set of immersive spaces, bound by the permeable requirements of being “constructed,” “temporary,” and “shared” experiences:

- audio/visual experiences through screens/headphones (mobile devices/mp3 players),
- the Internet (social media, virtual worlds like SecondLife),
video games,
- festivals and amusement parks (e.g. Burning Man, Disneyworld),
- backpacker tourism (e.g. Kathmandu, San Pedro, Bali),
- guilty pleasure vacations; “pay to immerse” (Vegas, Times Square, Phuket)
- drugs
- mixed reality technologies

The list could in fact go on and on, and the items themselves are not quite mutually exclusive or to equal levels of detail, which makes this not a very well-defined list. I had been enamored by the malleability of one’s reality and identity after studying the (re)construction of cultural memory through storytelling last semester; in what other ways are our realities already “mixed”?

In trying to account for a broader definition of “immersion,” I lost track of the original inspiration: the learning opportunities created by these immersive experiences to perform and re-imagine the self and others.

Going forward, I want to focus more on the learning aspects in one specific media: mixed reality technologies. The myriad of immersive experiences constructed using other media (i.e. what was formerly known as my work plan) will now be part of a design field scan. To recenter my work plan, I will focus on the following question and sub-questions:

1. How can memories of and lessons learned within immersive experiences be used to re-imagine or train for a different reality? This is based on the assumption that our sense of reality is based on our memories and that the reconstruction of memories are crucial for the imagination process.
2. What changes when immersion is shared with others?
3. Technology-specific: What are the technical limitations and health concerns of using virtual reality technologies?
4. Case studies: What are current applications of VR for re-imagining, training, and learning? Where are the challenges

There is much more about *The Art of Immersion* I want to unpack. This post is part of a short series I hope to write about it. For now, I'd like to share this great passage from the "Prologue":

> What is it about stories, anyway? Anthropologists tell us that storytelling is central to human existence. That it’s common to every known culture. That it involves a symbiotic exchange between teller and listener--an exchange we learn to negotiate in infancy. Just as the brain detects patterns in the visual forms of nature--a face, a figure, a flower--and in sound, so too it detects patterns in information. Stories are recognizable patterns, and in those patterns we find meaning. We use stories to make sense of our world and to share that understanding with others. They are the signals within the noise.
