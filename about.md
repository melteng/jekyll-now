My name is Melissa Teng and I'm an interactive designer + frontend developer with an arts and economics background. This is my digital space for my projects, artwork, writing, and thoughts.

Currently I am a [civic media](https://elab.emerson.edu/cmap) masters candidate at Emerson College, where I am interested in exploring the intersection of connective technologies, cultural memory, and creative placemaking. On the side, I research public participation in smart city initiatives with the [Engagement Lab](https://elab.emerson.edu/) and do web design at the [Open Documentary Lab](http://opendoclab.mit.edu/).

Previously I worked as the lead designer at [Datawheel](http://www.datawheel.us) creating open data platforms such as [datausa.io](https://datausa.io/), an award-winning site that reimagines how we experience government data. My work combines market, aesthetic, and HCI research as well as a deep passion for accessible and exciting user experience. I have worked across all aspects of the product design process - from product strategy, wireframing on paper/Sketch/Photoshop, visual design, to prototyping in code.

I received my undergrad degree in economics at Rice University. For the last two years, I was half of the curation team at [EMW Gallery](http://www.emwbookstore.com/), which strives to be a gallery space for artists from underrepresented, marginalized, or vulnerable communities.
